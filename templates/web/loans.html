                                            We proffer plenteous schemes for Gold loan towards the customers. We bolster a bouquet of products, catering to wide range of people based both in the rural and urban areas.

                                            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Interest Rate</strong></p>
                                            Our base rate of interest is 12 percent. However, depending upon how high the loan to value (LTV) is, additional interest (amounting to risk premium) ranging from 4-8 percent is charged over and above the base rate. The interest and risk premium is applicable only for the days the money was actually utilised. There are no prepayment penalties.Simple interest is charged, which the borrower has to pay at the specified periodicity or at the closure of loan, whichever is earlier. The interest rate is fixed and calculated on a reducing balance basis.<br/><br/>
                                            Gold loan products have a maximum tenure of one year. However, depending upon how high the LTV is opted,members are required to service the interest at specified periodicities.For example, in schemes where LTV is high, interest would have to be serviced monthly.<br/><br/>

                                            Our gold loan schemes fall broadly into two categories:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong> High loan to value:</strong> These schemes offer the maximum amount of loan per Gram. At the same time in keeping with the extra risk, the interest cost to the borrower is higher.</li>
                                                <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong> Low interest rate:</strong> In this category, the interest rates are lower but the Loan to Value (LTV) is also comparatively less.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            Our products are well tailored not only to the income group of the customer, but to relevant considerations like how much loan customers would like to avail against jewellery, and their comfort levels with respect to the interest rate and periodicity of repayment of interest and principal. Incidentally, gold loans can be availed at our branches for amounts as low as Rs.1000 and as high as Rs. 7.5 Lakhs.<br/>
                                            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Guaranty and Security</strong></p>
                                            We know that these gold ornaments are very precious and favorite to you. So we guarantee you that it will be in our safe hands in strong cash safes inside a strong room built as per the standards and specifications applicable to commercial banks. The pledged gold ornaments are also insured for full value. Moreover, security personnel and modern electronic surveillance technology are deployed to protect your beloved gold ornaments.</br><br/>
                                            The most important things from the customerâ€™s perspective are transparency, security and choice of loan product to suit individual requirements. Transparency would help the customer see for himself what he gets in return for what he pays. There should be no hidden costs and no nasty surprises.</br><br/>
                                            Security is about how well the gold is physically secured, and also about the internal systems and procedures at the company which ensure that there is no scope for any malfunctions after the jewelers have been pledged. The choice of loan products should cover the range from high LTV (loan to value) to low LTV, with appropriate variations in interest rates.

                                            A loan against an insurance policy allows policyholders to leverage the cash value of their life insurance for borrowing purposes.

Itâ€™s a valuable feature for policyholders who need temporary liquidity and wish to leverage the cash value they've accumulated within their life insurance policy.

                                            A loan against a government bond allows investors to utilize the value of their bond holdings as collateral for borrowing funds. Government bonds are typically considered low-risk investments issued by national governments to finance public expenditures. Hereâ€™s how a loan against a government bond generally works:</strong><br/><br>

                                                    </li>

This percentage can vary depending on the lender's policies and the type of bond.</span>
                                                    </li>

                                                The borrowing against a government bond can be a practical option for investors seeking liquidity while holding onto their bond investments. It provides flexibility and may offer favorable terms compared to other forms of borrowing, leveraging the stability and value of government securities. <br> <br>
